        Your personal life, your professional life, and your creative life are all intertwined.\n
        I went through a few very difficult years where I felt like a failure.\n
        But it was actually really important for me to go through that.\n
        Struggle, for me, is the most inspirational thing in the world at the end of the day - as long as you treat it that way.\n

        At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure.\n
        And the sooner you realize that, you accept that, and integrate that into your work ethic, you will start being successful.\n
        As long as you blame others for the reason you are not where you want to be, you will always be a failure.\n

        You can do anything as long as you have the passion, the drive, the focus, and the support.\n

        People go on about places like Starbucks being unpersonal and all that, but what if that what you want?
        I would be lost if people like that got their way and there was nothing unpersonal in the world.
        I like to know that there are big places without windows where no one gives a shit.
        You need confidence to go into small places with regular customersâ€¦
        I am happiest in the Virgin Megastore and Borders and Starbucks and Pizza Express, where no one gives a shit and no one knows who you are.
        My mum and dad are always going on about how soulless those places are, and I am like Der.
        That is the point.
